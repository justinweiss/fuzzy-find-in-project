;;; Commentary: 

;; Requires ruby, rubygems, and the `fuzzy_file_finder' rubygem. 
;;
;; The `fuzzy_file_finder' rubygem can be installed with the following command: 
;; `sudo gem install --source http://gems.github.com jamis-fuzzy_file_finder'

;;; Usage:
;; The primary interface into the functionality provided by this file is through
;; the `fuzzy-find-in-project' function. Calling this function will match the query to 
;; the files under `fuzzy-find-project-root' and open up a completion buffer with
;; the first matched file selected (with a `> '.) The selection can be changed using
;; `C-n' and `C-p', and the currently selected file can be opened using `<RET>'. 

;;; Configuration:
;; In your .emacs or init.el: 
;;
;; (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/path/to/fuzzy-find-in-project")
;; (require 'fuzzy-find-in-project)
;; (fuzzy-find-project-root "~/path/to/project")

;;; TODO: 
;; - Clean up *Completions* buffer on exit
;; - Use project-local-variables to scope the find to the current file's project
;; - misc. cleanup and error handling (make sure process is killed on failure, etc.)
